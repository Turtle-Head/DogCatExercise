# DogCatExercise <br>
Author:James Ferh <br>
written in C++ <br>
Class exercise: create two classes, `Dog` and `Cat`, each representing a specific type of pet. These classes will encapsulate the basic characteristics and behaviors of a dog and a cat.

# Requirements:

1. **`Dog` class**

    - Member variables:
        * `name` (std::string): The name of the dog.
        * `breed` (std::string): The breed of the dog.
        * `age` (int): The age of the dog in human years.

    - Member functions:
        * `bark()` (void): Print a message to the console that simulates the dog barking.
        * `getDogInfo()` (void): Print the dog's name, breed, and age to the console.

2. **`Cat` class**

    - Member variables:
        * `name` (std::string): The name of the cat.
        * `color` (std::string): The color of the cat.
        * `age` (int): The age of the cat in human years.

    - Member functions:
        * `meow()` (void): Print a message to the console that simulates the cat meowing.
        * `getCatInfo()` (void): Print the cat's name, color, and age to the console.<br>
1. The implementation of the `Dog` and `Cat` classes, including their constructors and destructors.

2. A `main()` function that:
    * Creates at least one instance of the `Dog` class and one instance of the `Cat` class.
    * Calls the `bark()` method and the `getDogInfo()` method for the `Dog` instance(s).
    * Calls the `meow()` method and the `getCatInfo()` method for the `Cat` instance(s).
